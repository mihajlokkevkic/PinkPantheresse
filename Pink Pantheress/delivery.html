      <p>Import fees & duties
        All orders ship from the UK. Please make sure you are prepared to pay any potential import fees to receive your parcel.
        
        Fees for EU customers
        If your delivery address is in an EU country there are no fees for orders under €150. This is because we are registered with the IOSS Scheme (EU Import One Stop Shop), meaning VAT and customs duties are already taken care of before delivery. This also means faster shipping times!
        
        We are aware that there are currently problems with IOSS and as a result you may be required to pay import duties upon delivery. Once you have paid the fee, please contact us via iossqueries@wmgcustomerservice.com with your order number and your receipt of the fee payment (e.g. proof of payment issued by your postal operator).
        IOSS Number: IM2500035267
        
        Orders over €150 will incur an import fee upon delivery. Unfortunately we are unable to tell you how much this will be as if differs from country to country. Check with your local customs office for information on taxes in your country.
        
        EU countries where this applies:
        Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
        
        Fees for the rest of the world (non-EU or UK deliveries)
        Orders that are delivered outside of the EU and UK will incur an import fee. Please be prepared to pay this to receive your parcel. Unfortunately we are unable to tell you how much this will be as if differs from country to country. Check with your local customs office for information on taxes in your country.
        
        If you have placed an order and do not wish to pay the fee to receive your order, please refuse the parcel and it will get returned to us free of charge.
        
        Once the item is returned to us, your refund will be processed within 30 business days. If you have any questions please contact us and we will be on hand to assist you.
